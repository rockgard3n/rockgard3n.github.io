"A beginners guide to creating your own Github page"
</h2>
<p>
  "1. Go to Github.com  and create an account" <br> "2. Click on the user icon on the top right an dclick on the "Your Repositories" in the dropdown" <br> "3. Click on the green "new" button"
  <br> "4. Name your repository as you see fit and you can just keep the default options for the others"
  <br>
  "5. From here lets make it simple and select the “upload existing files”" <br>
  "6. In your editor create a file called “index.html”" <br>
  "7. Within the same directory as “index.html” include an image file" <br>
  "8. In “index.html” include your desired code" <br>
  "8.2. Note an easy mistake is to create the index.html file in a native text editor rather than VScode or another basic text editor. For example the first time I tried to make the file I used TextEdit and when I saved it to html it included additional lines that derailed my efforts to successfully upload my website."
  <br> "9. Upload the directory with the image and index file to Github"
  <br> "10. At the bottom of the page hit “Commit Changes” button"
  <br> "11. Now if you hit your repository address you will be good to go!!"
